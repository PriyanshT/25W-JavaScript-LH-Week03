	<p>Arrays are a special type of list-like variable. Being able to organize data in a JavaScript array offers
		developers a lot of power and flexibility with their applications. This week we will look at how to leverage
		this very interesting type of variable.</p>

	var output = document.querySelector('body p:nth-of-type(2)');
	console.log(output);

	/* STEP 1: Creating an array
	When declaring and initializing an array, you can include strings, numbers, booleans, and even other arrays */
	var myArray = [1, 2, 3, "four", "five", "elephant", true, false, null, [10, 20, 30]];

	/* STEP 2: Reading and changing array elements
	You can refer to a particular element in an array with it's index number */
	output.textContent = myArray[0];
	output.textContent = myArray[9];
	// You can also change a particular element
	myArray[5] = "tiger";
	console.log(myArray);
	// An array within an array is called a multidimensional array - it can be accessed by specifying the index of the first array, then the item within it
	output.textContent = myArray[9][1];
	/* STEP 3: Determining array length
	Being able to figure out how many elements are contained in an array is a critical feature of JavaScript programming */
	output.textContent = myArray.length;
	output.textContent = myArray[myArray.length - 1];
	// var lastElementArray = myArray[myArray.length - 1]
	// var length = lastElementArray.length

	// In particular, looping through arrays
	for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
		console.log(myArray[i]);
	}
	/* STEP 4: Convert a string to an array If there is a common character that can act as a delimiter in a string, we can use this character to create an array */
	var myString = "dog, cat, elephant, tiger";
	var arrayFromString = myString.split(", ");
	console.log(arrayFromString);
	// Output one of the array items
	output.textContent = arrayFromString[2];
	// Output the last element of the array
	output.textContent = arrayFromString[arrayFromString.length - 1];
	/* STEP 5: Convert an array back to a string
	Use join() and toString() - note that join() allows you to choose and insert a delimiter, while toString() does not */
	output.textContent = arrayFromString.toString();
	output.textContent = arrayFromString.join(" -------------------- ");
	/* STEP 6: Adding and removing items from an array Without the ability to edit the contents of an array, this type of variable would have limited use - but adding and removing array items is pretty straightforward */

	// Adding one or more items to an array with push() 
	output.textContent = myArray.push("New Pushed Element");
	// Removing an item from an array with pop() 
	output.textContent = myArray.pop();
	// output.textContent = myArray.pop();
	// pop() returns the item that was removed, rather than the length of the updated array 

	// To do the same thing, that is, to add and remove an item from the beginning of the array, use shift() and unshift()
	output.textContent = myArray.unshift("New Unshifted Element");
	output.textContent = myArray.shift();
	/* That's it for the basics of working with arrays! With these tools at
		your disposal, a whole new world of possibilities with JavaScript are at your command */
